In continuation of our initial lab, our next task involves configuring and setting up roles, departments, SLAs (Service Level Agreements), and various topics.

<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>


<p>
Most of the setup requirements can be conveniently accessed from a single location. To access these settings, we simply need to navigate to the Admin Panel, which can be found in the top-left corner of the page. From there, we can proceed to the "Agents" section. Within this section, we will find options to configure Roles, Departments, Teams, and Agents.

Let's proceed with creating a new role called "Supreme Admin." This role will be granted extensive permissions, allowing the administrator to perform and modify various actions with flexibility. 
  
- Go to the "Roles" section in the Admin Panel.
- Click on "Create New Role" or a similar option to start creating the role.
- Give the role a name, such as "Supreme Admin" or any desired name.
- In the "Permissions" tab, select the checkboxes for "Tickets," "Tasks," and "Knowledgeable" to grant extensive access and control.
- Once all permissions are configured, save the role configuration.

<p>
  To create a new department named "System Administrators," please follow these steps:
  
  - From the same screen, navigate to the "Departments" section.
  - Look for an option such as "Add New Department" and click on it.
  - Provide the desired name for the department, such as "System Administrators."
  
    - Please note that there are additional options available for configuration from this screen, including adding managers, setting up outgoing email settings, configuring auto responders, and setting up alerts. For the purpose of this lab, we will skip these options.
  
  - Once all the necessary selections and entries have been made to your satisfaction, click on "Create Dept" to finalize the creation of the department.

</p>
<p>To access SLAs (Service Level Agreements) and Help Topics.
  
  Please follow these steps:

    - Within the Admin Panel, find the "Manage" section.
    - Click on either "SLA" or "Service Level Agreements" to access the SLA configuration.
    - Create three SLAs, naming them as desired. For this example, let's use "SEV-A," "SEV-B," and "SEV-C" to correlate with their respective time-frames and coverage.
       - "SEV-A" can have a 1-hour time-frame and provide 24/7 coverage.
       - "SEV-B" can have a 4-hour time-frame and provide 24/7 coverage.
       - "SEV-C" can have an 8-hour time-frame and be applicable during business hours.
    - Save the SLA configurations to create the three SLAs.

To create Help Topics, follow these steps:

    - Within the same "Manage" section in the Admin Panel, locate and click on "Help Topic."
    - Proceed with creating four help topics as follows:
        - "Business Critical Outage"
        - "Personal Computer Issues"
        - "Equipment Request"
        - "Password Reset"
    - Save the Help Topics for each topic created.

Great! Let's proceed with setting up some Users (customers) using the following steps:

- Click on the "Admin Panel" to access it.
- Within the Admin Panel, locate the option to switch to the Agent Panel.
- Once in the Agent Panel, find the "Users" section.
- Click on "Add New" or a similar option to create new user profiles.
- Using the same process we used for creating other environments, create two User profiles named Karen and Kevin. Feel free to modify the names as desired.
- Customize any additional details or settings for each user, such as contact information or preferences.
- Save the user profiles to create the Users Karen and Kevin within the system.

Now that we have a solid understanding of the process for creating these environments, we can apply a similar approach to setting up Teams and Agents. Let's proceed with the following steps:

Creating a Second Team ("Level II Support"):

1. Within the Admin Panel, locate the "Teams" section.
2. Click on an option such as "Add New Team" to initiate the team creation process.
3. Provide the name "Level II Support" or any other desired name for the team.
4. Configure any additional settings or preferences specific to this team, if applicable.
5. Save the team configuration to create the "Level II Support" team.

Creating Two Agents ("Jane Doe" and "John Doe"):

1. Navigate to the "Agents" section within the Admin Panel.
2. Look for an option such as "Add New Agent" to start adding agents to the system.
3. Provide the names "Jane Doe" and "John Doe" or any other desired names for the agents.
4. Customize any relevant details or settings for each agent, such as contact information or role assignments.
5. Save the agent profiles to create the agents "Jane Doe" and "John Doe" within the system.

By following these steps, you will successfully create a second team named "Level II Support" and two agents named "Jane Doe" and "John Doe" or any other desired names.
